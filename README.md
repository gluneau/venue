> A community engagement platform for the Volentix community

Venue is a platform which brings together members of the Volentix community to
facilitate distribution of VTX and thus grow the Volentix community.

Venue is a platform which brings together members of the Volentix community to
facilitate distribution of VTX and thus grow the Volentix community. This is
supported through:

* **Campaigns**: Users perform actions which earn them points, and users compete for
the most points. At the end of the campaign, a pool of VTX is split between the
competitors based upon how many points each person earns.
  * The first campaign is a signature campaign on the main Bitcoin Forum, known as
[Bitcoin talk](https://bitcointalk.org/). Users who maintain a Volentix signature earn
points for each post.
* **Bounties**: Work which is needed for Volentix projects is posted to Venue, and members
can accept and perform the work in exchange for a reward of VTX. This is the next main
feature to be added to Venue
* **News**: News relevant to the Volentix community will also be posted on Venue.

For deployment, we are using:
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  * [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/)
  * [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

The actual code is stored in sub-repositories:
* [Venue client](https://github.com/Volentix/venue-client)
* [Venue server](https://github.com/Volentix/venue-server)

We track all work in [waffle](https://waffle.io/Volentix/venue). This board contains issues
from all 3 repositories.
